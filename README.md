# graphs_data_structure
This repo holds the code for a Graph data structure class with various methods:

**addVertex / addVertices**
  - This function should add a node to the graph.

**addEdge**
  - This function should add an edge between two nodes in the graph and place each value of the nodes in each array for the value of the node in the adjacency list.

**removeEdge**
  - This function should accept two nodes and remove the edge between them. It should modify the adjacency list to ensure that both values are not in each array for the two nodes which no longer contain the edge.

**removeVertex**
  - This function should remove the node in the array of nodes and also remove all edges that the removed node previously contained.

**depthFirstSearch**
  - This function should return an array of nodes visited using DFS. You can do this iteratively (using a stack) or recursively, but note the order of the results will be different. Try to solve this without consulting the lecture notes!

**breadthFirstSearch**
  - This function should return an array of vertices visited using BFS. Try to solve this without consulting the lecture notes!
